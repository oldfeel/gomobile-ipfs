# gomobile-ipfs

This repo aims to provide packages for Android, iOS and React-Native that
allow one to run and use an IPFS node on mobile devices. It is also a place
to discuss the constraints of running IPFS on mobile in order to find
solutions and exchange tips.

:warning: _this repo is still experimental, contributions are very welcome_

You can check the packages documentation [here](https://ipfs-shipyard.github.io/gomobile-ipfs/).
